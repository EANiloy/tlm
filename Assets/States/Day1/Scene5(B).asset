  storyText: "You are afraid of the wild life. So you pick a tree and start climbing.
    You will be safe there for the night. You decide to leave all the other necessities
    for tomorrow. \r\n\r\nYou got on a high branch and try to be comfortable. You
    start to think how everything happened but nothing. Your memory is still empty.
    You realize you need to find food, water and some sort of shelter if you want
    to find your way out of the forest.\r\n\r\nWhile thinking all of these you doze
    off."
