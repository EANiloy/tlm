  storyText: "You open your eyes and find yourself lying in a jungle. It's dark and
    you can hear the howling of wolves from a good distance. You look at yourself
    and see your body painted with colors and something is written all over your
    body. Whatever piece of cloth you have on your body can barely be called clothing.
    You're feeling dizzy. Vision is getting blurred from time to time since you woke
    up. You are trying to remember what happened and how you got here, if you were
    alone or had any companion with you but you can't. Whenever you are trying to
    pressure your brain it hurts. It feels like you are hungry too. \r\n"
