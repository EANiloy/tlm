  storyText: 'Its been sometime you got to your senses. The world around you is now
    more visible. The sky is cloudy but there is moon light. The trees are dancing
    with the wind. You look around. You can see small to large rocks on the ground
    you start to look for a small but sharp rock. But its out of your reach. You
    start crawling to it. You can hear the wolves howling in the distance. You have
    to hurry. Finally you reach the rock and start cutting the ropes. You are free
    at last. You stand up and walk a little to let the blood start flowing. Now you
    have to decide how to spend the night. You cannot stay in this darkness unless
    you want to be dead meat.
