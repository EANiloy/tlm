  storyText: 'You try to move, you tremble with pain all over your body. It feels
    like someone or a group of people beat you up badly. You try to remember what
    happened once again but all you could feel is more pain in your brain. You realize
    you need to survive this wild more than you need to remember stuff. So you concentrate
    to get up and sit when you feel some pressure on your feet.  You cannot see your
    legs because of the darkness but you can understand they are tied with some sort
    of rope. What do you do?

'
  button1: 'Try to open the rope with your hand '
  button2: Look around to find something to cut the rope
