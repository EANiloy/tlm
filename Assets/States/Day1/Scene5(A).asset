  storyText: 'You start to look for some dry wood. you see some dead branches on
    the ground. You collect them into a pile and start hitting two rocks to get a
    spark. Within a few minutes you have a warm cozy fire in front of you. Now as
    you are settled in you start to think what might have been going on. You still
    cannot remember why or how you got here. Got where actually?

    

    You
    leave it as a problem for tomorrow. Also you need to find food and water too.
    You realize it is foolish attempt to go out in the dark tonight, so you lie on
    the floor and try to sleep.  '
