  storyText: "As you move you start hearing something in the front. Your heart pounces.
    Its the sound of waterfall. You start running towards it. Within a couple of
    moments your heart is filled with joy you see a small waterfall pouring out of
    a large mountain. You rushed to the water and start drinking. You don't know
    how much you drank but you can now hear the water moving in your belly. But you
    are happy. Now you concentrate on your wounds. The thorns were mean. They left
    their marks on your body very brilliantly. You wash them in the water. Now you
    bring out your $ and eat them. You decide to wait there to see if any one comes
    to the waterfall to fetch water.\r"
