    are going. You turn left keeping an eye on the birds. Then you turn left again.
    Now they are heading in a straight direction. You keep on following them.Suddenly
    you are halted by some thick bush. There are thorns everywhere. It would cost

    are saying there is water just past these thorns.\r"
