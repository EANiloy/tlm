  storyText: "Its easy now walking through the forest. You are moving north keeping
    the sun on your right. You plan to take a rest. You have brought some berries/bananas
    with you but you are too thirsty to eat. You sit on the grass and think about
    how everything might have happened but still nothing. You don't know where you
    are or where you are heading. You need some answers but now you need some water.\r"
