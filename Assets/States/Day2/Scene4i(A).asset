  storyText: "You carefully move through the thorns. Still they hurt you. The clothing
    you had (if they could be called clothing) are getting worsen, every step you
    take. Somehow you manage to get out of the bushes. Suddenly you see yourself
    in a small opening. The sun is burning bright. You are very thirsty and also
    tired. You don't wanna walk anymore but you have to. You don't want to go back
    through those thorns any more.\r"
