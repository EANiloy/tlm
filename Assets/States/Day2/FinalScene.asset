  storyText: 'You stay beside the waterfall to see if anyone comes. While keeping
    an eye you prepare for the night. You collect firewood and also found a hair.
    It will be a good meal tonight.

    

    Night has fallen. There is no cloud
    in the sky you can see the moon clearly. You set up a small fire. You think about
    the whole day. But you are happy that you have food and water with you. You are
    afraid of wild life but what can you do about it. You decide tomorrow you are
    going to follow the water stream downhill to see if there are any people down
    there.

    

    You fall asleep.'
